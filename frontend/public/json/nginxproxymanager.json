  "disable_description": "This script is temporarily disabled due to an external issue with the OpenResty APT repository. The repository's GPG key uses SHA-1 signatures, which are no longer accepted by Debian as of February 1, 2026. This causes installation to fail with APT errors. The issue is tracked in openresty/openresty#1097. A workaround exists but requires manual configuration. The script will be re-enabled once OpenResty updates their repository signing key. For more details, see: https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/issues/11406",
