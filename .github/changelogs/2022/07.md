### Changed

- **Home Assistant OS VM** 
  - Present the drive to the guest as a solid-state drive rather than a rotational hard disk. There is no requirement that the underlying storage actually be backed by SSD's. 
  - When the VM’s filesystem marks blocks as unused after deleting files, the SCSI controller will relay this information to the storage, which will then shrink the disk image accordingly.
